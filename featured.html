        <h3>Real-time 3D Graphing in Vanilla Minecraft</h3>
        <p>If you're going to play Minecraft to escape math, I'll bring the math to you.</p>
        <p>Made using functions in Vanilla Minecraft (that means no mods!), this graphing calculator can graph any function in the form y=f(x,z)!</p>
        <p>There aren't many 3D plotting programs out there, and if you don't need high accurary, I would say this is more helpful than many others already available because you can fly around them easily.</p>
        <p>A post of a shortened version of this video on reddit hit the front page of reddit, ending up as one of the highest rated posts in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fgzvi9/i_made_a_realtime_3d_graphing_calculator_in/">/r/Minecraft</a> with 90k+ upvotes.</p>

        <h3>HeroFair Amusement Park</h3>
        <p>Made by CommanderRedstone, Krissix, and lefserull over a course of 8 months, HeroFair Amusement Park is an amazing amusement park map made for Minecraft 1.12.2.</p>
        <p>Probably the biggest hit I've had on a project I was a main creator in. This map has 29k direct downloads from YouTube, 17k downloads on curseforge, 139k downloads on minecraftmaps.com, and more under the Minecraft Marketplace! (under NDA so download count cannot be disclosed)</p>
        <p>Now, I can't tell you how much revenue this map generated because of legal issues, but as of right now it's being sold for 830 minecoins, and you can purchase 1000 minecoins for around 6 USD. As of 2/20/2021, there are 3.4 thousand ratings (this is public information), although the rating system came months after HeroFair launched. Although 3.4 thousand ratings seems little, you have to realize that people rarely rate things in general. For example, on the Google Play store, there are apps with 10 million downloads but only 50 thousand reviews, and despacito has 7 billion views yet 45 million likes/dislikes; a lot, but not much compared to 7 billion. I personally don't know what the rate to purchase ratio is for content on the Marketplace but purely based on what I know about people, I'd assume not many people rate.</p>
        <p>This map features many functional rides that I can guarantee that you haven't seen before in Minecraft.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>Made entirely in minecraft, Reflections is a game that'll make you forget you're in Minecraft! With a custom UI system, navigate your way to various levels!</p>
        <p>But enough about the menu. The game works like this: There is a lazer, and you need to make the beams hit the mirrors. Using mirrors that you can push, rotate, or both, find clever ways to redirect the beam in the least amount of moves possible!</p>
        <p>Did I mention there's a level editor?</p>
